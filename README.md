# Python-as-R

## What is this?
    This is basically a lot of code that tries to use the math behind some of the function in R.

## How to test
    Run 'python -m unittest test.py' and the tests will run.

## Next Steps
    1) allow to use variable names for assigning functions
    2) more tests
    3) more automated testing for different stuff to check
    4) questionary for testing own files
